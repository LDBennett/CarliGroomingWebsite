      My name is <b>Carli Brierley</b> and I am a currently a student at Colorado Mesa University majoring in
      Sociology and minoring in Japanese. When I am not studying for exams or doing homework, I groom cats and dogs!
      I have been grooming for ~6 years and have not looked back. My love and passion for pets can be seen through
      the work I have done throughout the years.
    </p>

      My interest in grooming started after working various jobs that I realized were not the right fit for me. Then
      I found a job opening for learning how to become a groomer and the rest is history! I love all animals and want
      to make sure they always look their best!
